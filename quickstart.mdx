Before integrating Fonoster into your application, you need an account, setup the command-line interface, and link a virtual phone number. This guide walks you through those steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request early access">
    To get started, you need to request early access to Fonoster. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fonoster/discussions/695">GitHub Discussions</a> and following the instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a simple voice application">
    Voice applications in Fonoster require Node.js to run. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">official website</a>. Once you have Node.js installed, you can create a simple voice application by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    mkdir voice-app
    cd voice-app
    npm init -y
    npm install @fonoster/voice
    ```

    Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code:

    ```javascript
      const VoiceServer = require("@fonoster/voice").default;

      new VoiceServer().listen(async (req, voice) => {
        await voice.answer();
        await voice.say("Hello from Fonoster!");
        await voice.hangup();
      });
    ```

    Finally, run the application with the following command:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

    > Keep the application running for the next steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your application">
    To make your application available to the public, you must expose it to the internet. One way to do this is by using a service like <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a>. You can install ngrok by running the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install -g ngrok
    ```

    Once you have ngrok installed, you can expose your application by running the following command:

    ```bash
    ngrok tcp 50061
    ```

    This will give you a public URL that you can use to access your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link a virtual phone number">
    Follow the next steps to link a virtual phone number to your application:

    <Accordion title="Install the command-line tool">
      Fonoster CTL is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your Fonoster resources. You can create, update, and delete Fonoster resources like phone numbers, SIP trunks, etc.

      You can install the tool using the following command:

      ```bash
      npm install -g @fonoster/ctl
      ```

      Check that the installation was successful by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster --version
      ```

      If the installation was successful, you should see the version number of the command-line tool.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Log in to a Fonoster Workspace">
      Before using the command-line tool, log in to a Workspace. You can do this by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster workspaces:login
      ```

      This command will prompt you to enter your *AccessKeyId* and *AccessKeySecret*. Once you have entered this information, you will be logged in to your Workspace.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Create a new Application">
      To create a new Application, you can use the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster applications:create
      ```

      You will be asked to enter the Application's name, speech information, and other details. Once you have entered this information, the Application will be created.

      To confirm that the application was created successfully, you can run the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster applications:list
      ```

      Your output should show the newly created Application.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Link a Twilio phone number">
      To link a Twilio phone number to your application, you can use the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber
      ```

      You will be asked to enter the *Twilio SID* and *Twilio Auth Token*. Once you have entered this information, the Twilio phone number will be linked to your application.

      To confirm that the phone number was linked successfully, you can run the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster sipnet:numbers:list
      ```

      You can now call the Twilio phone number to access your voice application.

      > Twilio is used as an example. You can use other SIP providers as well.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Make an outbound call">
      You can use the command-line tool or the SDK to make an outbound call. To make an outbound call, first, you need the reference of the application you created. You can get the reference by running the following command:

      ```bash
      fonoster applications:list
      ```

      Once you have the reference, you can use the `fonoster sipnet:calls:create` command to make an outbound call. Here is an example:

      ```bash
      fonoster sipnet:calls:create --app-ref 4b01c9b1-8cb1-48fb-bd49-f3daf13463a9 \
       --from +18456134823 \
       --to +17853134923
      ```

      You can also use the SDK to make an outbound call. To do this, you can use the following code:

      ```javascript
      const SDK = require("@fonoster/sdk");

      # This is your Workspace Access Key ID
      const client = SDK.Client({ accessKeyId: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" });

      client.loginWithApiKey("AP0eerv2g7qow3e950k7twu4rvydcunq3k", "fNc...")
        .then(async() => {
          const calls = new SDK.Calls(client);

          const response = await calls.createCall({
            from: "+18456134823",
            to: "+17853134923",
            appRef: "4b01c9b1-8cb1-48fb-bd49-f3daf13463a9"
          })

          console.log(response);
        });
      ```

      Replace the example values with the appropriate ones.
