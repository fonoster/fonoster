# How to contribute

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Getting Started

* Fork the repository
* Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
* Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to your fork
* Submit a pull request
