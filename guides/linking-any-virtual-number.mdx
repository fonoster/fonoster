description: 'Connecting any SIP provider with Fonoster.'
---

This guide will walk you through connecting your SIP provider to Fonoster by setting up authentication, configuring a SIP trunk, and creating your virtual number. Follow the steps below to link any virtual number to your application.

<Note>
  For Twilio numbers, consider using the dedicated command 
  `fonoster sipnet:numbers:linkTwilioNumber` for a simplified process.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request early access">
    To get started, you need to request early access to Fonoster. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/fonoster/discussions/695">GitHub Discussions</a> and following the instructions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Authentication (If required)">
    If your VoIP provider requires SIP authentication, run the following command and follow the interactive prompts:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:credentials:create
    ```

    Before running this command, please request the necessary credentials from your provider.

    If your provider uses static IP authentication, provide them with the following IP address:

    **165.22.7.155**

    Your provider will use it to verify the origin of the signaling.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your SIP Trunk">
    Before creating your trunk, verify with your provider the preferred transport protocol (e.g., _TCP_ or _UDP_). Use the same protocol when specifying your _Outbound URI_. Use the following command to create your trunk:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:trunks:create
    ```

    Follow the prompts to complete the configuration. Ensure your _Inbound URI_ ends with `.sip.fonoster.com`. For example, if your company is **Acme Corp**, you might use `acme.sip.fonoster.com`

    <Note>
      The _Inbound URI_ must be globally unique. If you receive an error, please try using a different value.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create and Verify Your Virtual Number">
    With your trunk in place, create a virtual number to route incoming SIP traffic. Execute the command below:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:numbers:create
    ```

    You will be prompted for the details of your virtual number. Ensure that this number exactly matches the value your provider sends in the **FROM** header of the SIP traffic. Any discrepancy may prevent proper traffic matching.

    If you encounter an error such as "Number already exists," please contact the [Fonoster support team](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC). They will help resolve any conflicts with existing numbers.

    Finally, to check that your virtual number has been linked successfully, list your numbers with:

    ```bash
    fonoster sipnet:numbers:list
    ```

    Once the number is linked, try calling your virtual number to ensure that your voice application is accessible.
