/**
 * Fonoster Client (Server)
 *
 * @description This file exports a function to create a new instance of the
 * Fonoster Client for server-side environments. It uses the Node-specific build
 * of the Fonoster SDK and is configured via a predefined server config object.
 *
 * @note This wrapper allows centralized client configuration and caching,
 * which helps ensure consistent behavior and performance in server contexts.
 *
 * @TODO Remove this file when the Fonoster Client is officially exposed
 * by the main fonoster/sdk package in a platform-agnostic way.
